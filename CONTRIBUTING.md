## Code of Conduct

This project is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. By participating, you are expected to uphold our community standards of respect and collaboration.

## Project Overview

go-cache is a goroutine-safe generic flexible implementation of in-memory cache written in Go. It provides:

- Generic cache implementation with type safety
- Configurable TTL (Time To Live) for cache items
- Atomic operations for thread safety
- Loader functions for automatic value retrieval
- Flexible expiration policies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- Git

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/go-cache.git
   cd go-cache
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/tunein/go-cache.git
   ```

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

2. Run tests to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

3. Run tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   go test -cover ./...
   ```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Before You Start

- Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplication
- Discuss significant changes in an issue before implementing
- Ensure your changes align with the project's goals and architecture

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues and improve reliability
- **Feature enhancements**: Add new functionality
- **Documentation**: Improve README, code comments, and examples
- **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- **Performance improvements**: Optimize existing code
- **Code quality**: Refactor and improve code structure

## Code Style

### Go Code Standards

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the project
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and complex logic

### File Organization

- Keep related functionality together
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Group imports logically (standard library, third-party, local)

### Error Handling

- Always check and handle errors appropriately
- Use meaningful error messages
- Consider wrapping errors with context when appropriate

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- All new code must include tests
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Tests should be clear and readable
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests for a specific package
go test ./cache

# Run a specific test
go test -run TestCacheSet
```

### Test Structure

Follow the existing test patterns in the project:

```go
func TestFunctionName(t *testing.T) {
    // Arrange
    // ... setup code ...
    
    // Act
    // ... execute function ...
    
    // Assert
    // ... verify results ...
}
```
